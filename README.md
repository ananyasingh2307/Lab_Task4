This program demonstrates three stack applications: reversing a string, checking balanced parentheses, and simulating undo operations. It uses stacks to reverse characters, validate matching brackets, and manage undo commands by pushing and popping elements. The menu-driven interface allows users to choose and interact with these functions.
